# Logic Errors
Your program might run without crashing (no syntax or run-time errors), but still do the wrong thing. For example, perhaps you want a program to calculate the average of two numbers: the average of x and y is defined as
```python
x = 3
y = 4
average = x + y / 2
print(average)
```

Why doesn't this program work?
average = (x + y) / 2
that is a right format.
